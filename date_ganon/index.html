<h3>A Little About I</h3>
	<p>
		Born of the dark King and Queen and subsecquently killed them. I am gifted with powerful magic and often seek the omnipotent Triforce to grant my wish of conquering the entire world. I frequently wield the Triforce of Power, and stage coups against the Royal Family of Hyrule to take the Hyrulean Throne by force. In addition to granting me power, the Triforce of Power also allows me to transform into my more powerful beast form, reminiscent of a pig or hog.

<h4>The Best Birthday I've Had</h4>
	<p>OK this is weird to my fellow evil princes but I invited Link over for my birthday once. I was 4! Don't judge me! And he gave me a dozen bombs and almost 50 flaming arrows as a gift. I had no idea he loved weapons as much as I did! I then proceeded to violently attack everyone at my party and no one ever wanted to come to another birthday party of mine again. But damn it was good...

<h4>My Pet Peeves</h4>
	<p>
		I hate when people eat bags of chips in front of me. UGH! 
	</p>

	<p>
		Also nothing gets me more stressed out than leaving my kingdom with my phone almost dead. And I have to navigate the towns of Hyrule without my GPS.

<h4>My Worst Date</h4>
	<p>
		I was just getting over my 8th time losing to Link and Zelda. And there was this other dating website called conqueringWorldsDoesntDefineMeAsAPerson.com and the pics of this one girl with username CallmeSheikPLZ looked satisfactory. We met up near my castle river and she was all covered up. After we finished talking about the weather, she took off her face scarf and there I saw Zelda's face! She ran off giggling and chased her for 13 miles with my sword swinging at her.

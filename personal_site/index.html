<h2>About Quazar</h2>

<p>I am a humble man with little shortcomings.  I come from a land near the Hudson river with time spent swimming in that river.</p>

<p>I swam in it once or twice.<br />
Maybe even three times.</p>

<p>The clothes I wash are never ironed, possibly out of laziness, or out of complete conciousdecision. Belts dont fit me consistently.</p>

<h3><i>The Truth</i></h3>

<p>I am grateful for you and all you have to offer.  Yes you reading this.  You amazing person.  You are awesome.</p>
